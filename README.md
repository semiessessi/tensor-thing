some tensor thing i wrote inbetween doing my real job at virgin media in 2008.

recreated what i had in my inbox in source control with limited history.

(sadly not the final iteration, which i can not find, but had all the stuff for generating e.g. Christoffel symbols, Ricci tensor, Einstein tensor, Levi-Civita symbols etc... basically enough to do meaningful physicsy, and especially general relativity things)
